# Bagel Labs Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the Bagel Labs open-source Reinforcement Learning (RL) repository. 

This repo aggregates our public research and engineering efforts focused on applying RL to distributed machine learning systems—including but not limited to Large Language Models (LLMs). Current sub-projects include:

* **Tiny Tool Use** – an intentionally-tiny yet production-ready library for fine-tuning LLMs to make robust, auditable tool calls.

We plan to publish additional tooling, papers, and reference implementations here as they mature.
